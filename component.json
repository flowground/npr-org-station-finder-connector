            "description": "This endpoint has two main use cases:\n\n- If no query parameters passed in, it returns a list of stations that are geographically closest to the calling client (based on GeoIP information)\n- If one or more query parameters are passed in, it performs a search of NPR stations that match those search criteria (not taking into account the client's physical location)\n\nClients wanting to implement a 'Change Station' UI should use this endpoint to power their search. In most cases, you'll want to build a search interface that uses one of the 3 provided schemas: `lat` and `lon` (using e.g. the HTML5 Geolocation API), `city` and `state`, _or_ the generic `q` query which can accept a station name, call letters, network name, or zip code. Technically speaking, `q` can also take in either a city name or a state name, but using the `city` and `state` parameters together will yield more accurate geographic search results than `q={cityName}`.\n\nThe `lat` and `lon` query parameters should always be passed in together (otherwise the API will return a 400 error), and if included in the query, they will take precedence over any other search criteria; that is, `lat` and `lon` will do a purely geographic search and not take into account `q`, `city` or `state`.\n\nSimilarly, `city` and/or `state` will take precedence over (and ignore) `q`.\n\nIf clients want to be able to offer multiple types of searches (e.g. 'Search for a station name, city or zipcode') using a *single* search input form, `q` should be used. But again, be aware that using `city` and `state` together will yield more accurate search results than `q={cityName}`.",
